The plotting module consists of three layers.

The lowest-level layer is the backend. The middle layer is the context. The highest level is the frontend.

= The core =

The most fundamental element of yodaplot is the marker. This is an immutable reference to a point. You can do what you want with it, but it will always point to the same place in absolute space. It is able to be transformed into multiple coordinate spaces.

== Philosophy ==

This is essentially a domain-specific langauage for drawing, and aims to make as few assumptions about drawing. Where there are two reasonable ways that the same thing can be communicated, both are allowed.

== moving ==

Moving is achieved in multiple ways. Each coordinate is callable, therefore acts like a function. This can be used to provide an absolute coordinate in a space. 

There are times when you want to move in a direction relative to the current marker. The following 

> a = c(0,0).right(10)


== Drawing ==

In order to improve flow, all drawing is performed through markers. Each marker contains a `path'. When a user calls <<to>> on a marker, a new marker is constructed with a reference to the previous marker.

> c(10,10).to(20,20).draw()

Operators act on the list, and these actions usually change some form of mutable state. For instance, in drawing a path, an encapsulation of global state (the graphics context) will be instructed to change its state.

While most operations are stack based, there are often more conventional counterparts. For instance, c(10,10).rect(20,20) will draw a rectangle that is 20x20 with the bottom-left at the specified point.

== Flow ==

Now, suppose we wish to draw ticks along an axis. We probably want to start in the origin, and then switch into paper coordinate space to move by a fixed rather than relative amount.

> for i in ticks:
>     c.plot(0,0).x(i).paper.to.up(5)

When we call paper, we return a view of the current marker in a different coordinate space.

== Spaces ==

By default, there are four space that are commonly used.
  paper : This is the space you will use the most.
  plot : This is the space registered with the contextmanager for the current plot. This is only available in contexts where it makes sense.
  box  : This is a space relative to the current box. (0,0) represents the lower edge of the current box, and (1,1) represents the top right

== Zooming ==

Sometimes it is necessary to enlarge a region of the current space. Zooming is achieved by putting the diagonal onto the stack and then calling zoom.

> zoomed = c(10,10).to(50,50).zoom

Note that the existing marker remains unmodified. There is no operation that changes markers. For this reason, we have adopted the convention of using brackets only after functions which modify the mutable state. These are usually the last things you wish to do, and may or may not return a modified marker.

This is also very convenient for passing paramters. For instance, the draw, fill, and filldraw actions all take parameters.
